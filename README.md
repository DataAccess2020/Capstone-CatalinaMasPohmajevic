#Capstone Project: Security Analysis in Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina 2017-2019

Capstone Project on Security in the City of Buenos Aires during the period of 2017-2019. 

Triggered by the well-known levels of insecurity in Latinamerica and my experience as inhabitant of the city of Buenos Aires, the scope of the project was to analyze security in the metropolitan city through web scraping to access public datasets for performing quantitative data analysis.
The file contains the R code, the RMarkdown (.rmd), and a deliverable HTML for visualizing and publishing the research.
